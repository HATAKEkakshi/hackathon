Our AI model is designed to provide easy interface for people to connect with history and to quench their curiosity.
Our model mainly focuses on providing information about many different languages which have now been lost in the pages of time. 
One of the interesting feature of our model is to interpret the meaning of ancient fonts and languages by using the information of different civilizations and cultures available by analysing a large sum of data at a time.
